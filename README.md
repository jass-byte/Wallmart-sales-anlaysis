 Walmart Sales Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from multiple Walmart branches to uncover trends, optimize business decisions, and generate actionable insights. Using Excel, Power BI, and SQL, I performed end-to-end analysis covering data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

🧩 Problem Statement
Walmart operates across multiple cities with thousands of daily transactions. However, stakeholders lacked clear visibility into:

Which branches or product lines perform best

What times drive the most revenue

Which customer types generate higher profit

Whether discounts and ratings influence sales

✅ Solution
By conducting comprehensive data analysis, I delivered a dashboard and detailed insights to help Walmart:

Identify top-performing branches and peak hours

Understand the effect of customer demographics on purchases

Optimize product line offerings based on profit and quantity sold

Make decisions backed by visual analytics and pivot summaries

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel

SQL (MySQL Workbench)

Power BI

📊 Key Excel Techniques & Functions Used
Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, split text using Text to Columns, handled inconsistent date formats

Functions:

IF, IFS, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH

COUNTIF, SUMIF, IFERROR, LEFT, RIGHT, MID, LEN

TEXT, CONCATENATE, PROPER, UPPER, LOWER

PivotTables & PivotCharts: Summarized product line sales, city-wise revenue, customer types

Conditional Formatting: Highlighted top-selling branches and low-revenue days

Named Ranges & Dynamic Tables for better formula handling

Data Validation & Dropdowns for interactivity

📌 Power BI Dashboard Highlights
Interactive filters for city, gender, and product line

Dynamic visuals: bar charts, donut charts, KPIs, and slicers

Revenue, tax, and gross margin tracked across dates, branches, and time slots

🔍 SQL Contributions
Queried to filter top customers, branch-wise trends, and monthly summaries

Used clauses like GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHERE, HAVING

Handled date functions like MONTH(), YEAR(), and subqueries to isolate key segments

📈 Key Insights
Branch C generated the highest revenue but Branch A had the best customer satisfaction

Evening hours (6–9 PM) had peak footfall

Health & Beauty and Food & Beverage were top-performing product lines

Female customers slightly outspent male customers on average

Higher ratings correlated positively with repeat purchases
